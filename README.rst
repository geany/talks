Geany Talks
===========

This is a collection of slides for talks about Geany. They were done
mostly in German by using TeX-generated slides. However, somebody might find it useful to introduce Geany - feel free to use for
you own slides and spread the word.

Compile
-------

To compile the slides just go into your language (e.g. German)
and run

pdflatex geany.tex

This will create a PDF you can use for your talk.

Dependencies
------------

You will need to have a TeX-distribution installed on your system
including pdflatex and latex-beamer packages. For presentation of
course you will need also a PDF-viewer (e.g., evince)
